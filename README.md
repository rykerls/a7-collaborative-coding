Submission
----------

Before submitting your assignment, please create a `Readme.md` file **in your repository** to answer the following questions (submit the URL of your group's repo as your assignment):

##### 1. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.

> Patrick Smith, Luke Baker, Laura Rickey, and Ryker Schwartzenberger worked as a group on this project. We did not get any outside help.

##### 2. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

> Each group member spent somewhere between 1-3 hours working on their issue.

##### 3. On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?

> Considering that the project proposal was due on the same day, I think the challenge presented to us in this assignment was about right.

##### 4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

> We had some issues resolving merge conflicts at the end of this assignment. I know we went over how to resolve them in class but I still had quite a bit of trouble actually doing it. Perhaps some more practice during class time will help future students with this.

Please submit this GitHub repository to <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1023398/assignments/3079017" target="_blank">Canvas</a> as your assignment, and thanks for your hard work!
